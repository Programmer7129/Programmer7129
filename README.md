# Hello, I'm Vedant Patel üëã

## About Me

I‚Äôm a **Computer Science senior at UC Davis** with deep expertise in building scalable, cloud-native AI systems. As a Software Engineering Intern, I‚Äôve architected containerized, load-balanced pipelines using RAG-based LLMs on Azure and AWS. In my UC Davis research role, I led TinyML and Health-LLM initiatives‚Äîdelivering a quantized ECG anomaly detector (IEEE ISCAS accepted) and a personalized Health LLM via fault-tolerant, event-driven data pipelines.
